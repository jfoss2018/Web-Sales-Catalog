# Catalog

Small commissioned web app project for an online catalog that does not include ecommerce. The purpose of this app is for the user to have a place to advertise personal products for sale before the potential customer has to come see the product and waste time if they're uninterested.

### What does it do?

This web app helps save users time by being able to advertise their products for sale online to weed out any window shoppers from wasting time meeting in person. This tool is meant for local sellers, but can reach everyone if they're an interested enough buyer.
